I am passionate about animations. \r\n\r\nI have a special interest in playing and developing video games. Counter-Strike is still at the top of my favourite games list. Apart from video games, I love swimming and trekking. I won 1 gold and 4 silver medals in swimming at the KVS national level and 12 gold medals at the regional level and was awarded by the district collector for the same on 26th Jan 2006. I even attended 3 national level trekking camps in different regions of the Himalayan range. My life is extremely exciting with adventurous sports. In the year 2017, I drove the bike at the world's highest motorable road and made a bike trip to 'Leh, Kashmir'. I jumped from a height of 83 meters static platform with just a rope tied on my legs, Bunjee jump. I dived approx 25 meters below the water with an oxygen cylinder at my back, Scuba diving. I jumped from a height of approx 10,000 feet from Cessna 172 plane with an instructor and parachute on my back, Sky diving.\r\n",
