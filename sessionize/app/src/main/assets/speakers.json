One evening the man in charge took him aside, looked at him with haunted eyes, and said: \"Don't become an archaeologist.\" \r\n\r\nSo Richard got himself a PhD in distributed computing and embarked on a career in tech instead. At some point he took a wrong turn and got lost in the middle of Mongolia. That day he realized the importance of great maps.
