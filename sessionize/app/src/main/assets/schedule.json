Switching context and multitasking kills productivity. Every developer needs fast feedback, so he can get jump into the flow state. Therefore, fast builds are essential for productive development. \r\n\r\nFirst, we take a look into Gradle Build Scans. There is no sense in accelerating your build without measuring and comparing the different outcomes. Gradle Build Scans help you to understand what happens during your build and which parts consume the most time. \r\n\r\nThen we continue with basic tips to tweak your build with Gradle. Most of those tips are quick wins, because they only require a simple change in the Gradle build settings. \r\n\r\nFinally, we take a look into how modularisation influences the build speed by an example. Doing it right you can change your business logic and run your tests in 2 seconds instead of 2 minutes.",

From IO 2018 with the announcement of project Nitrogen, Google'd like to \"nitrogenize\" our tests creating a single entry point and solve all issues we had in the past. With October release of Robolectric 4.0 and androidx.test 1.0.0, both testing environments are converging on a set of common test APIs. Robolectric now supports the AndroidJUnit4 test runner, ActivityTestRule, and Espresso for interacting with UI components. Let's see togheter how to organise different levels of our 'test pyramid', with a focus to the last news/releases in order ot be ready for the Nitrogen release.",

This talk doesnât deal with the details of bluetooth on Android. Instead, we will discuss the strategies and methods we used and how it can be applied to any refactoring of dangerous code.

Switching context and multitasking kills productivity. Every developer needs fast feedback, so he can get jump into the flow state. Therefore, fast builds are essential for productive development. \r\n\r\nFirst, we take a look into Gradle Build Scans. There is no sense in accelerating your build without measuring and comparing the different outcomes. Gradle Build Scans help you to understand what happens during your build and which parts consume the most time. \r\n\r\nThen we continue with basic tips to tweak your build with Gradle. Most of those tips are quick wins, because they only require a simple change in the Gradle build settings. \r\n\r\nFinally, we take a look into how modularisation influences the build speed by an example. Doing it right you can change your business logic and run your tests in 2 seconds instead of 2 minutes.",

The age of voice assistants is here with Alexa, the Google Assistant and others. But, as an Android developer, what can I do on my existing app in relation to conversational features?\r\n\r\nWhen we think about developing features that are voice-forward, we think about existing voice assistants such as Alexa and the Google Assistant. What about the fully-capable computers that we have with us all the time, our smartphones? Some moments on our day to day lives are very well suited for voice interactions: while in a car or cooking for example. Let's not forget that voice interactions are extremely accessible, not only in a physical way (for people with dexterity or motion impediments) but also in a cognitive way (I think we all have a loved one in our lives that really struggles with technology, and people from some emerging countries have very limited access to computers and are not at ease with technology).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll explain what integrations can be done on Android:\r\n- 1st-party solutions such as the SpeechRecognizer and TextToSpeech APIs\r\n- Other Google solutions such as ML Kit, TensorFlow and Dialogflow\r\n- 3rd-party solutions such as Porcupine, Snips, Amazon Lex, Snowboy and PocketSphinx\r\n- Integration with the Google Assistant via App Actions",

Now we have a new tool in our toolbox - Coroutines - and they seem better suited to a typical Android business layer. It doesn't mean RxJava should be entirely out of the window, as for us it's still quite useful on the UI layer.\r\n\r\nWe're here to share why and how we went from a heavily RxJava based SDK architecture to a more client and developer-friendly approach replacing most of our code with Kotlin & Coroutines and compare both solutions.\r\n\r\nWe will admit to mistakes, share the principles that guided us in our planning for fixing them and show you how we came up with a plan and executed it.",

Nowadays most applications are modularized to a certain degree - to combat high compile times, enforce separation of concerns or to group code based on certain scopes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will take a look at navigation in modularized apps. Navigation in Android can be done explicitly by passing the class variable or implicit by sending an Intent with a certain configuration. Since modularization is supposed to simplify our dependency graph, we will take a closer look at deep linking as a navigation pattern and compare different approaches like Intent filter, a custom deeplink processor or the Android Jetpack Navigation component. \r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you will be able to modularize your application with a clean, structured and scalable navigation.

The user thinks about the data also over which he will be downloading or updating that app. He or she even think about how much space will it take on his or her device. In this fight of space in the device and size of the app, the apps having a smaller size and frequent utility wins the battle. \r\n\r\nWhat if we provide very basic functionality and let the user decide whether he wants the advanced or additional functionality or not. What if he or she can download only the features he needs on demand and keep the app compact. \r\n\r\nGoogle new feature of dynamic delivery enables us to deliver the features on demand. This helps us to reduce the size of APK and even enables the user to choose what features he needs. From a developers perspective, this is very easy to implement and maintain.\r\n\r\nEven we (Sharechat) were also at the same state where the size of APK was an issue with the new set of features we were trying to implement. Google Dynamic delivery came to the rescue.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually a dynamic delivery?\r\nHow can we reduce the APK size with it?\r\nHow it can help a user?\r\nHow to implement it in Android?\r\nHow difficult is it to implement in the existing code base?\r\nHow will it look to the user in the app?\r\n\r\nWell, let's get all these questions answered in the talk along with our experiences and challenges we faced.",

It promises to simplify the way we create animation on Android. Based on XML we will be able to describe on animation that could connected to a swipe on the screen or a native component.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will explore an Android app that list version of Android. For each version we will discover a new example, starting with basic modification of a constraint. Then adding KeyFrame with position, scale and rotation. Next playing with customs attributes to change the image color saturation. Lastly we will explore connection with Coordinator Layout, View Pager, Drawer and SeekBar.\r\n\r\nAt the end, you should know how to use and what are the capabilities of MotionLayout. Should you use it in your application ?\r\n\r\nWant to know more, you can read this article : https://medium.com/xebia-france/move-my-app-with-motionlayout-part-1-7800637feb22",

RxJava has already proven its stability and usefulness, and a comparison between the two frameworks shows that they are simply better suited for different purposes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk youâll learn:\r\n- how to utilise the strengths of each framework\r\n- how to correctly choose the best solution for the requirements of your project\r\n- whether it may be beneficial to migrate or run them concurrently\r\n- and how you can start doing so for your project",

For first time users of an app, entering login details is the most annoying thing according to various articles.  The result of this is losing potential customers of an app. Thankfully, there are many different and easy ways to register and login nowadays. Google Sign-in, SmartLock or Autofill framework are only a few examples to achieve a better user experience. A few clicks â and voalÃ¡ â you have a new user.   \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I want to share with you different ways to register and login to apps that result in less effort by the user.

Nowadays most applications are modularized to a certain degree - to combat high compile times, enforce separation of concerns or to group code based on certain scopes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will take a look at navigation in modularized apps. Navigation in Android can be done explicitly by passing the class variable or implicit by sending an Intent with a certain configuration. Since modularization is supposed to simplify our dependency graph, we will take a closer look at deep linking as a navigation pattern and compare different approaches like Intent filter, a custom deeplink processor or the Android Jetpack Navigation component. \r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you will be able to modularize your application with a clean, structured and scalable navigation.

You're probably confident with the code you wrote and you know what is doing.\r\n\r\nBut what about the code that others wrote?\r\n\r\nWe pull dependencies from the online repositories every day. Our applications strongly rely on external libraries that are hosted on public Maven repositories. What if one of those library contains some malicious code? Imagine a library that starts harvesting your user data without you knowing it.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will see how to monitor and protect your application from malicious dependency on the web that might end up in your final compiled App.",

The user thinks about the data also over which he will be downloading or updating that app. He or she even think about how much space will it take on his or her device. In this fight of space in the device and size of the app, the apps having a smaller size and frequent utility wins the battle. \r\n\r\nWhat if we provide very basic functionality and let the user decide whether he wants the advanced or additional functionality or not. What if he or she can download only the features he needs on demand and keep the app compact. \r\n\r\nGoogle new feature of dynamic delivery enables us to deliver the features on demand. This helps us to reduce the size of APK and even enables the user to choose what features he needs. From a developers perspective, this is very easy to implement and maintain.\r\n\r\nEven we (Sharechat) were also at the same state where the size of APK was an issue with the new set of features we were trying to implement. Google Dynamic delivery came to the rescue.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually a dynamic delivery?\r\nHow can we reduce the APK size with it?\r\nHow it can help a user?\r\nHow to implement it in Android?\r\nHow difficult is it to implement in the existing code base?\r\nHow will it look to the user in the app?\r\n\r\nWell, let's get all these questions answered in the talk along with our experiences and challenges we faced.",

Furthermore, youâll be able to use familiar components such as LiveData or RxJava to interface with your existing architecture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk youâll learn:\r\n- how to integrate the PagedList component into your architecture\r\n- how to implement a DataSource to load snapshots when necessary\r\n- how to use BoundaryCallback to signal the end of available data\r\n- how to integrate LiveData or RxJava to fit your project",
