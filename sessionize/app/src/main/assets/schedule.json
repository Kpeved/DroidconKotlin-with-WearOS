We create pieces that sit in everyone’s pocket and joins them throughout the day.\r\n \r\nApp creators play a major role in how people feel connected. We know if they feel strangled by over-connection. We know if they feel excluded by struggling to communicate. Often we know what their mood is, due to how an app communicates back to them.\r\n\r\nToday we know our power, and our responsibility. We know that we contribute to an inclusive world, a communicating world, a connected world, a well being and a balanced world.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore how you can create a wonderful communication experience for your users, right in the space between their Joy Of Missing Out (JOMO) and Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).\r\n\r\n",

With a focus on re-engagement, you can use slices to bump your metrics. You'll also learn about other features on Android to design for apps metrics.",

This talk will be about the framework, how it compares (favorably) to other options, the current state of the ecosystem, and where developers eager to get involved in significant open source contributions can get started.\r\n\r\nAs Droidcon SF is about 6 weeks out from KotlinConf, it'll be a fantastic time to recap announcements, and review follow on developments.",

And that was fine! The last couple of years and after the introduction of the material design principles, this is not the case anymore. The users expect some meaningful feedback about their actions, that will not interfere though with the flow of their interaction and it will be \"normal\" to the eye. Very recently, Google unveiled a lot of new, amazing tools that can help you take your app to the next level, engage your users more by offering a meaningful and fun experience, without causing you headaches anymore",

But over time, new features came into play, network calls, asynchronous processing, your little baby turned out to be a monster and you loose yourself in the code, it’s not possible to tell in which state your app is between network calls, errors, user interactions, etc.. You’re lost !\r\n\r\nGrox is an open source library (https://github.com/groupon/grox) that helps to manage the state of Kotlin / Java / Android applications. Inspired by Flux and Redux, Grox lets you express state changes in a testable and homogenous way. Grox offers a flexible, scalable way to manage the state of your application. With Grox you know in which exact state you are at any point in time, and you state will be represented clearly. Grox also offers time travel debugging, and a nice Rx API that plays very well with RxBinding and asynchronous code. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explain why Grox is nice, give a few examples to use it, test your code and enjoy it’s scalability. You will see that Grox is a breeze to manage from the simplest app to the most complex ones.",

No matter how feature rich or well architected an app is, a jarring user experience casts a shadow on all the hard work that we do. \r\n\r\nThe application I worked on lacked consistent design across its many screens. While the designers worked hard to create mocks using Material Design guidelines, the app still looked mismatched. The standardization work easily fell by the wayside as product prioritized other projects with tight deadlines. As a result, we ended up with a feature heavy application that lacked a clean, pleasant user experience. After meeting with another team at the company that had implemented the concept of a shareable “UI Toolkit” component in their app, I decided that engineering needed to combine efforts with design to bring their UI standardization project out of the backlog.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover how to create a shareable UI module for an Android application, the value that adds, and how to use Material Design and the Material Theming tool to create an app with a consistent, beautiful UI. Beyond that, I will share how to convince your product team to prioritize this project, how to work with the Design Team to bring their work into the implementation, and which tools to use to enable the process.",

Any app that wants to go beyond simple user interactions and perform even basic functions like network or disk access, is multithreaded. We usually use provided abstractions to handle this for us, and rarely peek under the hood. In this talk we'll take a look at some threading strategies such as, thread looper, round-robin scheduler, priority queue scheduler, and bounding of thread pools; strategies that are used in the Android platform itself, and by RxJava. It dives deep into the benefits and tradeoffs of different threading approaches, from both, a pure java and an Android perspective. At the end of the talk, you will understand how your apps are currently using threads, what the potential problems are and how you can go about manage your threads efficiently.\r\n",

In the past 3 years, we have changed quite dramatically: all mobile code now lives in a single monorepo alongside React Native, there are over 150 mobile contributors, and we made a huge migration from TeamCity to Buildkite in 2017. Along the way, we have had many interesting and mobile specific problems related to release management and automation, flaky tests, CI vs local build environments, and the list goes on. Something unique about our Android build process is that we use both Gradle and Buck in our day to day development. Engineers use Buck for their local development because of its impressive build speeds, but we release to the Play Store with Gradle builds for its reliability and certification as the Google recommended standard. Our release process is well integrated into our CI and a large amount of work has gone into taking advantage of our CI to automate certain release-related tasks. Some of these include scheduling QA, Alpha, and Beta builds, string translation updates, and making branch cuts.",

But how does an engineer validate that their improvements actually work? More importantly, how does the team prevent future performance regressions?\r\n\r\nOver a year ago, we at Slack asked these questions and decided to build a mobile performance testing pipeline that would continuously validate every code change for performance impact. In this talk, I will introduce the basic building blocks of this pipeline and share the lessons learned from building and maintaining this infrastructure.",

Users pay a lot of money for data and, in the worst case, with millions of users, your app can send enough traffic to your servers to cause serious problems.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we came to the conclusion that we need a systematic way of making mobile traffic safe.  In this talk, I’ll discuss how we designed and built a tool for monitoring and managing all network traffic from inside the app.  Using our monitoring tools, we’re able to detect and diagnose anomalous traffic.  If necessary, with an external signal, we can safely shut off specific types of mobile traffic until the underlying issue can be fixed, protecting users’ batteries and data plans.  ",

The problem with manually written and maintained docs is that they can become outdated quickly and typos frequently arise, so now not only do you have to fix the docs, you also have to spend time resolving the confusion you caused your users.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will introduce the concept of Documentation as Code by using ΛNK https://github.com/arrow-kt/ank, a way of automating documentation verification alongside the source code. ΛNK is a tool written using ΛRROW https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow that inspects code snippets in library docs for Kotlin and Java.\r\n\r\nWe will learn how the ΛNK plugin works: from having a tool that evaluates and verifies your doc snippets at compile time, to generating code documentation that is always correct and up to date. We will also show how to integrate ΛNK with your CI service and how it can be configured. Finally, we will review several successful projects that took advantage of all these features in order to create amazing documentation sites http://arrow-kt.io/ with the best documentation.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you will be itching to automate your documentation, and know how to get started with ΛNK!",

We create pieces that sit in everyone’s pocket and joins them throughout the day.\r\n \r\nApp creators play a major role in how people feel connected. We know if they feel strangled by over-connection. We know if they feel excluded by struggling to communicate. Often we know what their mood is, due to how an app communicates back to them.\r\n\r\nToday we know our power, and our responsibility. We know that we contribute to an inclusive world, a communicating world, a connected world, a well being and a balanced world.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore how you can create a wonderful communication experience for your users, right in the space between their Joy Of Missing Out (JOMO) and Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).\r\n\r\n",

With a focus on re-engagement, you can use slices to bump your metrics. You'll also learn about other features on Android to design for apps metrics.",

HTTP/2 improvements like server push, file streaming, and TCP connection optimizations will change the way we use the Internet. Although the underlying networking libraries for Android will continue to handle the protocol changes automatically, it's good for developers to understand the intricacies of HTTP/2 so they can take full advantage of the new feature set.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll be going through the notable new features of HTTP/2, how app developers can adapt to ( and fully leverage) the changes, and what improvements can HTTP/2 bring to your mobile app.\r\n",

              "description": "Kotlin Native, with the ability to produce iOS code, was announced at KotlinConf 2017. With rapid progress on the runtime and tools, and intense community interest, several major architectural libraries have been released. KotlinConf 2018 will definitely see significant releases both, in both libraries and tools, and likely an official v1 of Kotlin Native.\r\n\r\n2019 will be the year of significant application releases with a shared architectural base, powered by Kotlin multiplatform. This talk will be about the framework, how it compares (favorably) to other options, the current state of the ecosystem, and where developers eager to get involved in significant open source contributions can get started.\r\n\r\nAs Droidcon SF is about 6 weeks out from KotlinConf, it'll be a fantastic time to recap announcements, and review follow on developments.",

In the past 3 years, we have changed quite dramatically: all mobile code now lives in a single monorepo alongside React Native, there are over 150 mobile contributors, and we made a huge migration from TeamCity to Buildkite in 2017. Along the way, we have had many interesting and mobile specific problems related to release management and automation, flaky tests, CI vs local build environments, and the list goes on. Something unique about our Android build process is that we use both Gradle and Buck in our day to day development. Engineers use Buck for their local development because of its impressive build speeds, but we release to the Play Store with Gradle builds for its reliability and certification as the Google recommended standard. Our release process is well integrated into our CI and a large amount of work has gone into taking advantage of our CI to automate certain release-related tasks. Some of these include scheduling QA, Alpha, and Beta builds, string translation updates, and making branch cuts.",

And that was fine! The last couple of years and after the introduction of the material design principles, this is not the case anymore. The users expect some meaningful feedback about their actions, that will not interfere though with the flow of their interaction and it will be \"normal\" to the eye.

But how does an engineer validate that their improvements actually work? More importantly, how does the team prevent future performance regressions?\r\n\r\nOver a year ago, we at Slack asked these questions and decided to build a mobile performance testing pipeline that would continuously validate every code change for performance impact. In this talk, I will introduce the basic building blocks of this pipeline and share the lessons learned from building and maintaining this infrastructure.",

Inspired by Flux and Redux, Grox lets you express state changes in a testable and homogenous way. Grox offers a flexible, scalable way to manage the state of your application. With Grox you know in which exact state you are at any point in time, and you state will be represented clearly. Grox also offers time travel debugging, and a nice Rx API that plays very well with RxBinding and asynchronous code. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explain why Grox is nice, give a few examples to use it, test your code and enjoy it’s scalability. You will see that Grox is a breeze to manage from the simplest app to the most complex ones.",

              "description": "Making mobile apps is inherently riskier than making a normal website: code you write sticks around potentially forever and, in the best case, updates take several hours. Unwanted or unexpected network traffic has a high cost as well. Users pay a lot of money for data and, in the worst case, with millions of users, your app can send enough traffic to your servers to cause serious problems.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we came to the conclusion that we need a systematic way of making mobile traffic safe.  In this talk, I’ll discuss how we designed and built a tool for monitoring and managing all network traffic from inside the app.  Using our monitoring tools, we’re able to detect and diagnose anomalous traffic.  If necessary, with an external signal, we can safely shut off specific types of mobile traffic until the underlying issue can be fixed, protecting users’ batteries and data plans.  ",

No matter how feature rich or well architected an app is, a jarring user experience casts a shadow on all the hard work that we do. \r\n\r\nThe application I worked on lacked consistent design across its many screens. While the designers worked hard to create mocks using Material Design guidelines, the app still looked mismatched. The standardization work easily fell by the wayside as product prioritized other projects with tight deadlines. As a result, we ended up with a feature heavy application that lacked a clean, pleasant user experience. After meeting with another team at the company that had implemented the concept of a shareable “UI Toolkit” component in their app, I decided that engineering needed to combine efforts with design to bring their UI standardization project out of the backlog.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover how to create a shareable UI module for an Android application, the value that adds, and how to use Material Design and the Material Theming tool to create an app with a consistent, beautiful UI. Beyond that, I will share how to convince your product team to prioritize this project, how to work with the Design Team to bring their work into the implementation, and which tools to use to enable the process.",

Any app that wants to go beyond simple user interactions and perform even basic functions like network or disk access, is multithreaded. We usually use provided abstractions to handle this for us, and rarely peek under the hood. In this talk we'll take a look at some threading strategies such as, thread looper, round-robin scheduler, priority queue scheduler, and bounding of thread pools; strategies that are used in the Android platform itself, and by RxJava. It dives deep into the benefits and tradeoffs of different threading approaches, from both, a pure java and an Android perspective. At the end of the talk, you will understand how your apps are currently using threads, what the potential problems are and how you can go about manage your threads efficiently.\r\n",

That is fairly universally accepted, but what's worse is when what your metrics tell you isn't true.  This talk discusses what you can do to prevent your metrics from misleading you.",

It allows for enhanced security, significantly better ART & native performance, larger addressable memory, greater numeric precision, a richer instruction set, and the advantage of other new and modern features not available with 32-bit code. \r\nEqually, new workloads such as, machine learning, 3D gaming, and even 4K displays are taxing the limits of the 32-bit ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and require more compute capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe move to a 64-bit Android world is imminent and it is likely that you will have a body of legacy 32-bit software which may need porting as well as new code which needs to be written.\r\n\r\nIn this in-depth talk, Arm will outline the technical rationale and benefits of 64-bit, the considerations which must be taken during the transition, as well as hints and tips to ensure a pain-free transition into 64-bit so your apps can avail of the benefits for increased performance.\r\n",

The problem with manually written and maintained docs is that they can become outdated quickly and typos frequently arise, so now not only do you have to fix the docs, you also have to spend time resolving the confusion you caused your users.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will introduce the concept of Documentation as Code by using ΛNK https://github.com/arrow-kt/ank, a way of automating documentation verification alongside the source code. ΛNK is a tool written using ΛRROW https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow that inspects code snippets in library docs for Kotlin and Java.\r\n\r\nWe will learn how the ΛNK plugin works: from having a tool that evaluates and verifies your doc snippets at compile time, to generating code documentation that is always correct and up to date. We will also show how to integrate ΛNK with your CI service and how it can be configured. Finally, we will review several successful projects that took advantage of all these features in order to create amazing documentation sites http://arrow-kt.io/ with the best documentation.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you will be itching to automate your documentation, and know how to get started with ΛNK!",

            "description": "Android has a variety of tools to deal with background work. Android provides different APIs with the AlarmManager and JobScheduler, but there are also many third party libraries like android-job and Firebase JobDispatcher. And more recently, Android architecture components introduced the WorkManager. How does this new component fit into the existing APIs and which gaps does it try to fill?\r\n\r\nThis talk gives an overview of the various job scheduler engines and how their capabilities have evolved alongside mobile ecosystems. The different APIs will be discussed and most importantly we will cover some best practices to avoid repeating yourself.",

            "description": "Often companies with large mobile user bases find that they have to balance rapid iteration with the amount of work involved in launching and coordinating a product on multiple platforms (web, native Android, and native iOS).\r\n\r\nFaced with exactly this question for the Airbnb reservation system, we designed a server-driven UI framework for web, iOS, and Android that allows us to launch new types of reservations on all platforms with a simple backend change. It uses a commonly shared API that is parsed on the client and rendered into a set of corresponding components supported on all platforms.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will discuss how we designed this multi-platform system to provide the flexibility needed to launch new types of reservations and UI components, while keeping boilerplate client code to a minimum. Using a common API across all platforms, this type of server-driven UI framework hits the sweet spot of customizability while minimizing redundant client-side work. Moreover, I’ll explain how this system has enabled us to deploy new features on all platforms simultaneously via a simple backend change, without having to release new versions of the native apps.\r\n\r\nIn the code deep dive, I’ll go through the API that is used on all three platforms, how the polymorphic API response is parsed on Android, and how those data models are rendered into a reservation using Epoxy, Airbnb’s open-source library for rendering models in a RecyclerView. \r\n\r\nFinally, I'll touch on some expanded use cases of this concept, such as multi-screen user flows for forms.\r\n",

Today it is at the heart of a broad range of applications, from logistics to games, from social networks to ridesharing.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore how a ridesharing app works.  We will ask questions such as: How do we find out where the passenger is located? How do we discover our destination? How do we find the closest driver? How do we provide a correct ETA to the passenger in heavy traffic? How do we display this information on a map? How do we find the best route to the destination?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, we will be learning about a variety of location APIs, including Maps, Positioning, Geocoding, Routing, Traffic, Places, and much more.\r\n\r\nAt the end you should be able to build your own ridesharing app or any clever app for which location matters.\r\n",

            "description": "With the rising popularity of Android mobile devices, the amount of malicious applications targeting the Android platform has been increasing tremendously. To mitigate the risk of malicious apps, there is a need for an automated system to detect these applications. Current detection techniques rely on the signatures of well-documented malware, and hence may not be able to detect new malware samples. The majority of these approaches are based on either the analysis of complex features extracted from the files present in Android executables (e.g., DroidSafe) or dynamic features derived from an app's behaviour during runtime. Extraction of such complex features is a tedious task and requires a considerable amount of time and system resources. With rapid increase in the amount and complexity of malware, it is beneficial to employ methods that do not rely on analysis of complex features and are time efficient. In this session, we will speak about an alternative solution. Instead of focusing on individual malware samples, we propose to turn our attention to malware developers. The benefit of this strategy is clear: generating a signature for malware developer rather than individual malware sample, we can effectively characterise all malware samples generated by a particular software developer. The primary premise for our work stems from authorship attribution field, typically used in literary domain. Author attribution domain assumes that each author possesses a unique writing style which can accurately identify his/her works among others. Our hypothesis is that a developer similar to an author has a unique programming style which is reflected through the various components of programs developed by him. By analysing such program components, we can possibly generate the author’s signature that can uniquely identify applications developed by that author. One of the simplest components that can represent an author’s writing style is a set of strings used by a developer throughout binary code. Various string components such as variables, class names, method names, and string literals reflect the writing preferences of the developer. We present an approach to identify an author of an given Android application using the author's signature (profile) comprised of different string components that can potentially reflect the Android author's style. Using these author signatures, we can effectively detect a wide range of existing, as well as any new, malware samples generated by particular authors.\r\n",

Join us to see an Android developer doing Swift, an iOS developer writing Kotlin and enjoy this thrill ride with two tour guides that will drive you out of your comfort zone while sharing their struggles and success to inspire you to learn the languages.

              "description": "Often companies with large mobile user bases find that they have to balance rapid iteration with the amount of work involved in launching and coordinating a product on multiple platforms (web, native Android, and native iOS).\r\n\r\nFaced with exactly this question for the Airbnb reservation system, we designed a server-driven UI framework for web, iOS, and Android that allows us to launch new types of reservations on all platforms with a simple backend change. It uses a commonly shared API that is parsed on the client and rendered into a set of corresponding components supported on all platforms.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will discuss how we designed this multi-platform system to provide the flexibility needed to launch new types of reservations and UI components, while keeping boilerplate client code to a minimum. Using a common API across all platforms, this type of server-driven UI framework hits the sweet spot of customizability while minimizing redundant client-side work. Moreover, I’ll explain how this system has enabled us to deploy new features on all platforms simultaneously via a simple backend change, without having to release new versions of the native apps.\r\n\r\nIn the code deep dive, I’ll go through the API that is used on all three platforms, how the polymorphic API response is parsed on Android, and how those data models are rendered into a reservation using Epoxy, Airbnb’s open-source library for rendering models in a RecyclerView. \r\n\r\nFinally, I'll touch on some expanded use cases of this concept, such as multi-screen user flows for forms.\r\n",

He’ll cover how it grew, the pain points discovered and lessons learned, and the tooling developed and open-sourced to scale to millions of users served by hundreds of contributors across many apps.\r\n\r\nTopics covered will include: Buck, Uber’s architecture solution, RIBs, Proper Experimentation, Continuous integration, Code Verification and Static Analysis, and the company processes needed to facilitate a large app.\r\n",

Thanks to the maps and location technology in our smartphones, a whole generation has now grown up in a world where getting lost is truly a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nLocation technology goes far beyond maps in the palm of our hand, however. Today it is at the heart of a broad range of applications, from logistics to games, from social networks to ridesharing.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore how a ridesharing app works.  We will ask questions such as: How do we find out where the passenger is located? How do we discover our destination? How do we find the closest driver? How do we provide a correct ETA to the passenger in heavy traffic? How do we display this information on a map? How do we find the best route to the destination?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, we will be learning about a variety of location APIs, including Maps, Positioning, Geocoding, Routing, Traffic, Places, and much more.\r\n\r\nAt the end you should be able to build your own ridesharing app or any clever app for which location matters.\r\n",

However, when it comes to Camera2, there's still a big hurdle for newcomers to understand the whole picture of how it works and what can be possible.\r\n\r\nOne reason why Camera2 confuses developers is that there are many callbacks that we have to manage just to take one picture.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I’m giving you a guide to understanding this complex system so that you can develop and customize your own Camera app. I’m going to explain the step by step photo shooting flow by looking into how each callback interacts with a Camera device. Then, I will dive into more advanced usage such as how to customize settings and add OpenGL shading into the process of shooting a photo or video. \r\n\r\nMy talk will be based on this blog post.\r\nhttps://proandroiddev.com/understanding-camera2-api-from-callbacks-part-1-5d348de65950\r\n",

              "description": "With the rising popularity of Android mobile devices, the amount of malicious applications targeting the Android platform has been increasing tremendously. To mitigate the risk of malicious apps, there is a need for an automated system to detect these applications. Current detection techniques rely on the signatures of well-documented malware, and hence may not be able to detect new malware samples. The majority of these approaches are based on either the analysis of complex features extracted from the files present in Android executables (e.g., DroidSafe) or dynamic features derived from an app's behaviour during runtime. Extraction of such complex features is a tedious task and requires a considerable amount of time and system resources. With rapid increase in the amount and complexity of malware, it is beneficial to employ methods that do not rely on analysis of complex features and are time efficient. In this session, we will speak about an alternative solution. Instead of focusing on individual malware samples, we propose to turn our attention to malware developers. The benefit of this strategy is clear: generating a signature for malware developer rather than individual malware sample, we can effectively characterise all malware samples generated by a particular software developer. The primary premise for our work stems from authorship attribution field, typically used in literary domain. Author attribution domain assumes that each author possesses a unique writing style which can accurately identify his/her works among others. Our hypothesis is that a developer similar to an author has a unique programming style which is reflected through the various components of programs developed by him. By analysing such program components, we can possibly generate the author’s signature that can uniquely identify applications developed by that author. One of the simplest components that can represent an author’s writing style is a set of strings used by a developer throughout binary code. Various string components such as variables, class names, method names, and string literals reflect the writing preferences of the developer. We present an approach to identify an author of an given Android application using the author's signature (profile) comprised of different string components that can potentially reflect the Android author's style. Using these author signatures, we can effectively detect a wide range of existing, as well as any new, malware samples generated by particular authors.\r\n",
