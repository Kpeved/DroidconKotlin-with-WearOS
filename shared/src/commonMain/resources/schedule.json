Developers can deliver products and services, minimize the time-to-market, and support the complete product lifecycle management, including promotion, user acquisition, monetization, and user retention—everything in less than 1MB.\r\n",

In this talk, we will take you along the journey of a Composable function, from being written, going through the unknown lands of the Kotlin and Compose compilers to being executed and displaying UI!  \r\n\r\nFrom Composables all the way down into the compiler plugins, we expose the metaprogramming responsible for all the \"magic\". Whether your interest is Jetpack Compose, compilers, or code transformations, this talk takes an otherwise complicated topic and makes it digestible for everybody by diving into specific features offered by Compose.\r\n\r\nBy examining Compose's snapshot system,  you'll follow the compiler phases down to intercepting code transformations with IR. By recognizing the patterns that make it hard for Compose to generate efficient code, and this can help us to recognize patterns to use for performance.",

No branches.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many questions on how to do that exactly. What about code reviews? QA testing? Product and business stakeholder approval? Unfinished features? And so on.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll answer all these questions and do a deep dive into the basic and advanced approach to Feature Toggles — one of the core enablers of TBD and CD.",

By taking the stance that every piece of code we write is an API we can build more versatile and scalable applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how you can apply best practices from the open-source world to your project, to guard implementations, provide concise and specific contracts, practical documentation mechanisms, and how doing so can aid (or harm) your build time.",

Ideally, the front-end team will be responsible for managing the BFF as well, and now we can do this with the support of Kotlin for Backend.\r\nDuring this presentation, we will discuss aspects of BFF and how we can implement it as a mobile team.",

This is why libraries are really powerful — Building an android library is easy, but building one that keeps in mind developer happiness is rare but not hard. And if you build something cool yourself, why not share it with the world?\r\nIn this talk, I’m going to share what I learned building an android library called PhotoEditor, which has become the most widely used android library for Photo Editing with 1,50,000 downloads so far. If you new to android or don’t know anything about Android or Photo editing, its fine since the learnings I want to share is about what it takes to build an open-source Android library and want I’ve learned from it.",

You'll also see how you can integrate Unity inside a native Android Java/Kotlin application, or how to get a full control of the build process so you can benefit from the best of both worlds. ",

This talk presents Quick Apps, a framework for mobile application development for Android, based on an MVVM architecture and the front-end web technology stack (JS, CSS, HTML) that implements the MiniApp specifications defined by W3C.\r\n\r\nQuick App enables developers to create \"light\" applications more efficiently through built-in components and access to devices' native resources (calendar, running in the background, network,…) with just 20% code lines than in native apps. Developers can deliver products and services, minimize the time-to-market, and support the complete product lifecycle management, including promotion, user acquisition, monetization, and user retention—everything in less than 1MB.\r\n",

By taking the stance that every piece of code we write is an API we can build more versatile and scalable applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how you can apply best practices from the open-source world to your project, to guard implementations, provide concise and specific contracts, practical documentation mechanisms, and how doing so can aid (or harm) your build time.",

In this talk, we will take you along the journey of a Composable function, from being written, going through the unknown lands of the Kotlin and Compose compilers to being executed and displaying UI!  \r\n\r\nFrom Composables all the way down into the compiler plugins, we expose the metaprogramming responsible for all the \"magic\". Whether your interest is Jetpack Compose, compilers, or code transformations, this talk takes an otherwise complicated topic and makes it digestible for everybody by diving into specific features offered by Compose.\r\n\r\nBy examining Compose's snapshot system,  you'll follow the compiler phases down to intercepting code transformations with IR. By recognizing the patterns that make it hard for Compose to generate efficient code, and this can help us to recognize patterns to use for performance.",

If you new to android or don’t know anything about Android or Photo editing, its fine since the learnings I want to share is about what it takes to build an open-source Android library and want I’ve learned from it.",

And so on.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll answer all these questions and do a deep dive into the basic and advanced approach to Feature Toggles — one of the core enablers of TBD and CD.",

Or you love the motion design and micro-interactions? \r\n\r\nAlthough Jetpack Compose is a toolkit to create Android UI in a declarative form with the power of Kotlin language. But it can be used as a canvas for generative art, animations, or even games.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the capabilities of Canvas API for Jetpack Compose and how can we implement different kinds of animations with it. We'll also dig into game development and discuss some common challenges like game loop, state management etc. We will also explore other UI animations and transitions with Jetpack Compose.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, we'll be more familiar with the concepts of Canvas in Jetpack Compose and how we can use it during development to write animations or games.",

We tend to forget how scary software development can be, and how discouraging working in a team of people that are more knowledgeable than you can feel.\r\n\r\nTo be a senior developer, you also need to be a teacher to your fellow junior developers. But how to teach them if you don’t understand their problems?!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will be tackling this problem.\r\nFirst, we will check what the causes of this problem are in the first place. Next, we will check different ways to overcome these issues. Finally, we will see how you can use your knowledge to help new developers make their first steps, how to be supportive, and help them become an irreplaceable part of the developer community.",

This means that if a user has a mobile app version with a bug, they’ll be stuck with that bug until a new version is released and they upgrade. As a result, the mobile app development life cycle is much less forgiving of bugs.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will be talking about how to optimize Android app deployments from development to production including different and important tips and practices for developing, testing, releasing, and monitoring.\r\n\r\n\t\r\nTags: Development, Testing,  Best practices, App distribution",

New weapons of mass destruction are invented year by year. Their names?

But we can already imagine their devastating powers. \r\n\r\nSome OEMs are more cruel than others. The darkest warlords of them all? Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus and Xiaomi in that order. They employ elite trained assassins called task killers whose insidious ways are yet to be documented. \r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to survive, but there is hope! A small group of relentless developers (let’s call them the Resistance) did gather around a project dontkillmyapp.com. They have risen up against the evil hordes of kill -9. They have years of experience with long running processes and alarms on Android since the carefree times of Cupcake till the dawn of Pie.

                        "description": "LiveData was never designed to be a full-fledged reactive stream. Thread management with LiveData is very hard and making data transformation with transformation operators is very limited. Moreover, testing LiveData becomes very tricky and is likely to open for race conditions if you are using it with coroutines.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Kotlin Flow provides asynchronously computed values with the power of Coroutines. Making data transformations becomes very easy with Flow intermediate operators. Furthermore, StateFlow provides caching the current state just like LiveData. Since there is a back-pressure in Flow, unit testing is much simpler with handy Flow terminal operators.\r\n\r\nKotlin Flow is a very powerful reactive stream with its robust operators. Using Flow instead of LiveData makes it easier to handle data transformations and background processes. Finally, testing Flow is much safer and painless compared to LiveData.",

The Firebase Emulator was released to combat this issue but it was not great to use as it was all done in the command line. Recently the Firebase UI Emulator was released and this had a significant improvement in helping developers work locally. In this talk, I will show how to get the Firebase UI emulators up and running and how this will improve your development process when working with Firebase. We will learn how to connect our Android app to a local Firestore instance that will be able to trigger Cloud functions locally. \r\n",

They even help detect visual regression bugs that Espresso/UiAutomator tests cannot. Indeed, they are more widely used than UI tests by big companies such as Airbnb, with ≈ 30.000 snapshot tests, and Uber, with thousand of snapshot tests vs. a handful of UI tests, among others.\r\n\r\nWhile there are plenty of resources about writing UI tests on Android, the same doesn't exist for snapshot tests.

How can it help speed up the design and the development of a mobile application?\r\nWe have to align the entire application to that design system, build re-usable components which will speed the development time up without creating too many issues, avoiding code repetition and creating something that our designers can check and interact with before the features using the designs are shipped.\r\nA design system uses components, and that's where we started from. We decided to mimic the idea of `widgets` from Flutter. We had to engineer our system in a way that allowed us to create small enough (but not too atomic) components, re-usable, avoiding making them too big and complex (hard to read and understand, hard to refactor, etc..).\r\nThe decisions, how we made them (team effort - with all the suggestions, opinions and conversations we had to come to a solution) and how we are now using them to speed up the development of our app.\r\nWhat problem we faced, how we solved them, how this impacted our development speed and approach over the weeks (and how it will impact us in the future).",

Big tech companies praise their apps with AI based features, highlighting a presence of dedicated hardware for neuronal networks in new products. \r\n\r\nWhile artificial intelligence is already affecting our daily life, the way how we develop software is going to change too. For example with AI based plugins for IDEs or APIs for translating natural language into a code. \r\n\r\nLet's have a look at the basics of data science and machine learning from a developer's perspective, so we can learn, extend and utilize new useful skills and techniques in software development. \r\n\r\nFinally we will also mention a gradient descent, an algorithm behind machine learning to get a picture, if it is really capable to write better code as a human can do.

This philosophy is sustainable and has a win-win approach.\r\n\r\nFor developers, it’s a good habit that can increase professionalism and produces values for the developer and the community. For a company, it helps to be visible and share your products, thereby increasing profits. That’s why all of the big players moved into it. As a company, you still have time to start in the open-source game and be distinctive thanks to your open-source activity. Don’t wait too much longer, though.\r\n\r\nThe speech is articulated in these sections:\r\n\r\n1) introduction about my personal journey to opensource. This is important to create a rapport with the attendees and create trust in the speaker.\r\n\r\n2) what stop opensource to enter the companies until now a complete overview of the issues that prevent the opensource philosophy adoption in companies (patents, intellectual property, etc..)\r\n\r\n3) benefits we are loosing in this section I will explain the opportunities and the opportunity revenue of opensource\r\n\r\n4) conclusion in this section will be presented a solution to harmonize pro and cons of opensource to create a profitable business model in enterprises that bring benefits to business and to the community\r\n\r\nThe speech is about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nYou can read an abstract of the speech on this article: - https://medium.com/better-programming/from-open-source-to-openmind-cb61ce05593a?source=friends_link&sk=adea560401b2d9def00c87d4cd86e4b1\r\n\r\nA demo pitch of the speech is here: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn2Wpkz6SJE&t=22s - https://speakerdeck.com/zeppaman/from-open-source-to-open-mind",

Using these data, we will continue to the details of Gradle profiling tools and experimentation, to reveal hidden issues of the build. Our practices of Gradle builds scan analysis and our experience with Gradle Enterprise will be shared as well.\r\n\r\nFollowing part will discuss observed effects of modularisation or caching improvements, which have both positive and negative effects. We will as well pay attention on optimising Gradle configuration time and effects of small local system environment differences of individual engineers, which may affect build significantly.\r\n\r\nOur build time journey shown us that when given some love, build time can be dramatically improved and help you with more effective product delivery, making your engineers to build faster and more often.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways\r\n- Measurement of all builds is a key.\r\n- Experiment with your builds the same like you experiment with your features.\r\n- Modularisation and caching can have both good or bad impact on build time.\r\n- Local optimisations can have huge impact.\r\n- Build time can be improved dramatically when receives attention - investment does not have to be too big.\r\n\r\nExperience Level\r\nThe app built is deployed to millions of users. The build time experience allowed me to explore internals of Gradle and understand into deep what is happening during the app build.\r\n\r\nTalk given before\r\n- No\r\n\r\nKeywords/Tags\r\nInfrastructure, CI, Gradle, Build, Engineering Productivity",

I'll also explain how similar Android Automotive OS is to other Android environments, and how, as a developer, with very little effort, you can provide your users with an in-vehicle experience which is an extension of their mobile/tablet rather than feeling like a disconnected add-on.",

Thread management with LiveData is very hard and making data transformation with transformation operators is very limited. Moreover, testing LiveData becomes very tricky and is likely to open for race conditions if you are using it with coroutines.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Kotlin Flow provides asynchronously computed values with the power of Coroutines. Making data transformations becomes very easy with Flow intermediate operators. Furthermore, StateFlow provides caching the current state just like LiveData. Since there is a back-pressure in Flow, unit testing is much simpler with handy Flow terminal operators.\r\n\r\nKotlin Flow is a very powerful reactive stream with its robust operators. Using Flow instead of LiveData makes it easier to handle data transformations and background processes. Finally, testing Flow is much safer and painless compared to LiveData.",

We decided to mimic the idea of `widgets` from Flutter. We had to engineer our system in a way that allowed us to create small enough (but not too atomic) components, re-usable, avoiding making them too big and complex (hard to read and understand, hard to refactor, etc..).\r\nThe decisions, how we made them (team effort - with all the suggestions, opinions and conversations we had to come to a solution) and how we are now using them to speed up the development of our app.\r\nWhat problem we faced, how we solved them, how this impacted our development speed and approach over the weeks (and how it will impact us in the future).",

Over the years we have become accustomed to writing apps in a bottom-up approach, building core business components first and wiring the layers with the UI later. In this traditional approach the management and modeling of state, along with how it impacts the UI layers of our apps, are often an afterthought. \r\n\r\nWorking with Compose requires a fundamental shift in how we think about UI and its state. In this talk, we will migrate an existing app over to Jetpack compose. In the process, we will cover migrating state to a single source of truth, how to decompose a screen into smaller more flexible components and how to avoid common performance pitfalls in Compose that often go unnoticed.",

But it can be used as a canvas for generative art, animations, or even games.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the capabilities of Canvas API for Jetpack Compose and how can we implement different kinds of animations with it. We'll also dig into game development and discuss some common challenges like game loop, state management etc. We will also explore other UI animations and transitions with Jetpack Compose.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, we'll be more familiar with the concepts of Canvas in Jetpack Compose and how we can use it during development to write animations or games.",

BLE is now easier to work with, much thanks to small additions to the platform APIs, but also with the introduction of new services and APIs in the framework.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will look at how to write apps for BLE peripherals like smart watches and other IoT devices. We'll look at best practices, common pitfalls, and even what to require from the engineers writing the embedded code for peripherals. \r\n\r\nHopefully this session will be useful for all who are working with BLE in any capacity, or simply have an interest to learn more.",

This philosophy is sustainable and has a win-win approach.\r\n\r\nFor developers, it’s a good habit that can increase professionalism and produces values for the developer and the community. For a company, it helps to be visible and share your products, thereby increasing profits. That’s why all of the big players moved into it. As a company, you still have time to start in the open-source game and be distinctive thanks to your open-source activity. Don’t wait too much longer, though.\r\n\r\nThe speech is articulated in these sections:\r\n\r\n1) introduction about my personal journey to opensource. This is important to create a rapport with the attendees and create trust in the speaker.\r\n\r\n2) what stop opensource to enter the companies until now a complete overview of the issues that prevent the opensource philosophy adoption in companies (patents, intellectual property, etc..)\r\n\r\n3) benefits we are loosing in this section I will explain the opportunities and the opportunity revenue of opensource\r\n\r\n4) conclusion in this section will be presented a solution to harmonize pro and cons of opensource to create a profitable business model in enterprises that bring benefits to business and to the community\r\n\r\nThe speech is about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nYou can read an abstract of the speech on this article: - https://medium.com/better-programming/from-open-source-to-openmind-cb61ce05593a?source=friends_link&sk=adea560401b2d9def00c87d4cd86e4b1\r\n\r\nA demo pitch of the speech is here: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn2Wpkz6SJE&t=22s - https://speakerdeck.com/zeppaman/from-open-source-to-open-mind",

With the goal to ship more and faster as well as to compete in an ever changing industry, we can (and must) do better. \r\n\r\nThis talk will cover best practices for performance, stability, security, and maintainability of CI/CD pipelines with a focus on developing for Android, each supported with practical examples and counterexamples.\r\n",

Let's see how use this new declarative UI framework in an already structured and organised project maintaining its own design pattern architecture. \r\nWhat will be the advantages and disadvantages?\r\n\r\nUnified Test Platform (UTP), best known as project code Nitrogen, it's another fantastic tech presented this year at Google IO. Let's see together what it is, why is so useful and why we should adopt it in our app.\r\nWe will use this extensible test executor to 'nitrogenize' our UI test suite covering some UI cases in our project. Let's scale together our test suite with Gradle managed devices in parallel using new test metrics, and finally, inspecting test results and possible failures by emulator snapshots.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you will know if your app architecture is ready for Compose,  you will be ready to transform your test suite into a more reliable scalable and productive env and you will speed up the delivery and the code quality of your project.",

However, the Inversion of Control pattern brings a lot of architecture features and safety.\r\nIn this talk, we will see how to use all the power of Kodein-DI (a popular dependency injection framework that works everywhere Kotlin can compile to) in a mobile multi-platform project targeting Android through Kotlin/JVM, iOS through Kotlin/Native and the mobile Web through Kotlin/JS.\r\nFirst, we will see how to use DI to abstract and test multi-platform business modules as well as how to debug common binding and retrieval errors. Next, we will abstract & test behaviour by embedding the DI framework into popular behaviour architecture patterns such as MVP & MVVM. Finally, we will enhance our code using the advanced features of Kodein-DI such as set bindings, lazy access, context and scopes.",

Using these data, we will continue to the details of Gradle profiling tools and experimentation, to reveal hidden issues of the build. Our practices of Gradle builds scan analysis and our experience with Gradle Enterprise will be shared as well.\r\n\r\nFollowing part will discuss observed effects of modularisation or caching improvements, which have both positive and negative effects. We will as well pay attention on optimising Gradle configuration time and effects of small local system environment differences of individual engineers, which may affect build significantly.\r\n\r\nOur build time journey shown us that when given some love, build time can be dramatically improved and help you with more effective product delivery, making your engineers to build faster and more often.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways\r\n- Measurement of all builds is a key.\r\n- Experiment with your builds the same like you experiment with your features.\r\n- Modularisation and caching can have both good or bad impact on build time.\r\n- Local optimisations can have huge impact.\r\n- Build time can be improved dramatically when receives attention - investment does not have to be too big.\r\n\r\nExperience Level\r\nThe app built is deployed to millions of users. The build time experience allowed me to explore internals of Gradle and understand into deep what is happening during the app build.\r\n\r\nTalk given before\r\n- No\r\n\r\nKeywords/Tags\r\nInfrastructure, CI, Gradle, Build, Engineering Productivity",

One of the fallbacks of firebase products in the beginning was that you always needed to connect to the real online instance and could not develop locally. The Firebase Emulator was released to combat this issue but it was not great to use as it was all done in the command line. Recently the Firebase UI Emulator was released and this had a significant improvement in helping developers work locally. In this talk, I will show how to get the Firebase UI emulators up and running and how this will improve your development process when working with Firebase. We will learn how to connect our Android app to a local Firestore instance that will be able to trigger Cloud functions locally. \r\n",

They even help detect visual regression bugs that Espresso/UiAutomator tests cannot. Indeed, they are more widely used than UI tests by big companies such as Airbnb, with ≈ 30.000 snapshot tests, and Uber, with thousand of snapshot tests vs. a handful of UI tests, among others.\r\n\r\nWhile there are plenty of resources about writing UI tests on Android, the same doesn't exist for snapshot tests.

Build systems, frameworks and libraries or even new programming languages are only a few to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it is a matter of course, that a camera app in your mobile phone is powered by artificial intelligence. Big tech companies praise their apps with AI based features, highlighting a presence of dedicated hardware for neuronal networks in new products. \r\n\r\nWhile artificial intelligence is already affecting our daily life, the way how we develop software is going to change too. For example with AI based plugins for IDEs or APIs for translating natural language into a code. \r\n\r\nLet's have a look at the basics of data science and machine learning from a developer's perspective, so we can learn, extend and utilize new useful skills and techniques in software development. \r\n\r\nFinally we will also mention a gradient descent, an algorithm behind machine learning to get a picture, if it is really capable to write better code as a human can do. In this short trip you will see not only some math, but also a Kotlin code. \r\n\r\nYour are going to learn:\r\n\r\n* basic principles of neuronal networks\r\n* to rediscover a love for math\r\n* how not to fear the AI future, math and how to become a better developer.\r\n",

We cannot truly trust flaky tests. Instrumentation testing will continue to be part of our lives even with Jetpack Compose therefore, we need stability.\r\n\r\nRunning all UI tests before merging any code is possible, and it saves us a lot with 400+ integration tests. Unfortunately, stability is not something that comes out of the box. A certain level of architecture, proper thread usage, and test setup with helper rules are required. There is an uncountable number of things that affect UI tests. \r\n\r\nGood thing, there are explanations and solutions for most of the flakiness. In this talk, you will learn more about best practices to increase test stability, how to utilise Test-Driven Development with UI testing, and how this will help you find bugs earlier.\r\n",

Every new Android OS version is less merciful about your background processes. Different OEMs kill your apps straight away without asking if you do something useful for your users or not. New weapons of mass destruction are invented year by year. Their names? Doze mode V1!, Doze mode V2!, Background restrictions!, Adaptive battery! and more are coming this year whose evil names are yet to be known. But we can already imagine their devastating powers. \r\n\r\nSome OEMs are more cruel than others. The darkest warlords of them all? Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus and Xiaomi in that order. They employ elite trained assassins called task killers whose insidious ways are yet to be documented. \r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to survive, but there is hope! A small group of relentless developers (let’s call them the Resistance) did gather around a project dontkillmyapp.com. They have risen up against the evil hordes of kill -9. They have years of experience with long running processes and alarms on Android since the carefree times of Cupcake till the dawn of Pie. And they are here to share tips and guides with users and developers on how to survive in those dark times. Viva la Resistance! \r\n\r\nP.S. we have cookies and a guitar song at the end!",

Most teams use Crashlytics from Firebase because it is powerful yet simple. Operating in 50+ countries and processing 10+ Millions of orders per day, we needed to take Crashlytics to the next-level.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we would like to share our experience on how we built our custom crash-reporting tooling that is built using powerful tools like Google BigQuery, and Google Data Studio. Using Google BigQuery also gave us the ability to transform and clean our raw data and join with Firebase Analytics datasets. At the end of our presentation, we would like to present a couple of real-life scenarios and show you how we used our custom dashboard to decrease our root cause finding time and saved our engineers time more than 40%.",

It is not surprising that it has been quickly adopted both at open-source projects and private-source projects, with Android being no exception to that\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll review the fundamentals of Github Actions as a CI/CD platform and learn how to make the most of it when designing and implementing automations particularly important for Android projects. We'll learn about particularities and limitations one might find when moving a big Android project over Github Actions and review most of the common solutions we have for Android-specific use cases. \r\n\r\nTags : CI/CD, Automation, Github Actions, Mobile DevOps",
