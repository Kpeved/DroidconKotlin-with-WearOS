            "description": "Every day each one of us turns to community contributions to help us become better developers — blog posts, open source projects, conference talks, podcasts, and so much more. Can you imagine if these resources didn’t exist?!\r\n\r\nAnd while our community is strong today, it’s healthiest when it continues to grow from a broad set of interests, backgrounds and opinions. That diversity and knowledge to keep our community strong can only come from one place: YOU.\r\n\r\nI’ll share my thoughts about how this community has helped me (and others) grow, why that’s so important, and ultimately why it’s crucial for all of us to contribute. I’ll discuss five (or so) areas, each with some high level tips to get you started, that we can all contribute to to keep our community strong and healthy.\r\n\r\nYou’ll leave this talk not just grateful for our wonderful community, but also inspired to get started on contributing back too!\r\n\r\nThe Android community has proven to be one of the most welcoming, friendly, helpful, generous groups I’ve ever encountered. Let’s keep it going!\r\n",

R8 is coming as the default shrinker, the tool which removes and optimizes code.

This talk will cover those advantages both in the scope of your entire application but also with very localized examples in a single class or method. We'll also look at some tricks that D8 and R8 can do which their predecessors could not. Finally, we'll cover how to enable both tools in your build and recommendations to ensure you're getting the most out of each.",

A new very flexible testing framework, based on learning from many years of Junit 4.\r\nAt sporttotal we use this for our Android unit tests and it changed the way we write tests. Hard for us to imagine living without features like @Nested. Other features we ignored as those are more leaning towards Java and are solved already by Kotlin or other Kotlin libraries. And some features are even breaking changes. How do you test on Android in a world without TestRunner and TestRules? \r\nAndroid testing team was always very slowly in adopting to new Junit versions, so how far can we bypass this?\r\nLet's do a deep dive into Junit5, how it works and how we can use it on Android",

In response to the signal, your phone buzzes and tells you about the store's sale on running shoes. This presentation describes features of Estimote's SDK for beacon-enabled Android apps. The presentation includes demonstrations using real beacons in the real-life Droidcon conference environment.",

Thanks to the maps and location technology in our smartphones, a whole generation has now grown up in a world where getting lost is truly a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nLocation technology goes far beyond maps in the palm of our hand, however. Today it is at the heart of a broad range of applications, from logistics to games, from social networks to ridesharing.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore how a ridesharing app works.  We will ask questions such as: How do we find out where the passenger is located? How do we discover our destination? How do we find the closest driver? How do we provide a correct ETA to the passenger in heavy traffic? How do we display this information on a map? How do we find the best route to the destination?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, we will be learning about a variety of location APIs, including Maps, Positioning, Geocoding, Routing, Traffic, Places, and much more.\r\n\r\nAt the end you should be able to build your own ridesharing app or any clever app for which location matters.",

A classic challenge is resizing large camera images for upload.\r\n\r\nAt Facebook we've also failed hard with these issues. But we've learned a lot along the way about image format internals, native libraries and keeping image processing efficient, reliable and sane.\r\n\r\nTogether, we'll go down to the metal and see how you can utilize this knowledge to make your users benefit: process images losslessly, choose the right parameters, avoid BitmapFactory fiddling and employ compression best-practices.

Today it is at the heart of a broad range of applications, from logistics to games, from social networks to ridesharing.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore how a ridesharing app works.  We will ask questions such as: How do we find out where the passenger is located? How do we discover our destination? How do we find the closest driver? How do we provide a correct ETA to the passenger in heavy traffic? How do we display this information on a map? How do we find the best route to the destination?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, we will be learning about a variety of location APIs, including Maps, Positioning, Geocoding, Routing, Traffic, Places, and much more.\r\n\r\nAt the end you should be able to build your own ridesharing app or any clever app for which location matters.",

A new very flexible testing framework, based on learning from many years of Junit 4.\r\nAt sporttotal we use this for our Android unit tests and it changed the way we write tests. Hard for us to imagine living without features like @Nested. Other features we ignored as those are more leaning towards Java and are solved already by Kotlin or other Kotlin libraries. And some features are even breaking changes. How do you test on Android in a world without TestRunner and TestRules? \r\nAndroid testing team was always very slowly in adopting to new Junit versions, so how far can we bypass this?\r\nLet's do a deep dive into Junit5, how it works and how we can use it on Android",

A classic challenge is resizing large camera images for upload.\r\n\r\nAt Facebook we've also failed hard with these issues. But we've learned a lot along the way about image format internals, native libraries and keeping image processing efficient, reliable and sane.\r\n\r\nTogether, we'll go down to the metal and see how you can utilize this knowledge to make your users benefit: process images losslessly, choose the right parameters, avoid BitmapFactory fiddling and employ compression best-practices. We'll also cover established and upcoming image formats.",

Google allows you to register test accounts in the Play Store so you won't be charged, but you still have to contend with slow cancellation times, a limited set of accounts, and the need to have a deployed version of your app in the Play Store.\r\n\r\nWhat if you could manage inventory and purchase data locally, allowing test users to experience your app in any state, and work through your purchase flow at any time, all with minimal changes to your code?  \r\n\r\nThis talk will look at BillingX, a new library from Pixite that allows you to do exactly that with almost no changes to your code. We'll discuss the inner workings of how BillingX is implemented, how it can be integrated into your existing projects, and how you can either use it or easily create your own implementation.",

It turns out that there's a science to this madness, and we can all learn to build better APIs without just blindly following good practices.

It will focus on how SQLDelight can be best used from both Android and iOS while feeling natural to Kotlin and Swift users alike, and go over features introduced in the release that affect all platforms. Finally we will explore the future of multiplatform including other components of your app which are good or bad candidates for making platform agnostic and what future releases of SQLDelight will include.",

But the challenges have evolved, as recognizing the input can be done via an API (like DialogFlow), we also need to consider the interface and how to  give an experience so natural that it seem like a human conversation. \"Oh hi, how are you holding up? because I'm a potato\" it's not longer enough, we need conversationally-enabled Android apps built with a different set of design concepts. In this talk we'll review examples of conversational interfaces, benefits of having one on your app, and the core principles for the design process of conversational experiences.",

As you pass by a shoe store, your phone picks up a signal from a walnut-sized beacon in the store window. In response to the signal, your phone buzzes and tells you about the store's sale on running shoes. This presentation describes features of Estimote's SDK for beacon-enabled Android apps. The presentation includes demonstrations using real beacons in the real-life Droidcon conference environment.",

This tool goes a long way to enforcing good practices in your code base.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, the library performs checks against these rules by analyzing the abstract syntax tree provided by the Kotlin Compiler. In this talk, we will learn about how to setup Detekt and how to create custom rules. We will also take a deep dive into how the library enforces these rules by using the abstract syntax tree.",

But, sometimes, building the full experience from scratch in both Kotlin and Swift is not a good option.\r\n\r\nWhen we at Meetup were launching a new, mobile-first product and wanted a new mobile app — only the second native app in our fifteen-year history — we wanted to build a great product on both platforms, but we only had a few engineers and a couple of months to do so.\r\n\r\nReact Native, with its promise to deliver truly native-quality experiences from a completely shared codebase, is one of the popular alternative ways to build a mobile app, but a lot of its documentation is targeted at web developers who want to make iOS apps. How should mobile engineers think about React Native? What dragons need particularly careful slaying on Android?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll give a brief overview of how React Native works. We’ll share how we went from \"git init\" to a functioning app in two months, and talk about where we went from there. We’ll cover the things that still excite us about React Native, but be frank about its continued pitfalls. We’ll talk about how React Native fits into the broader space of cross-platform mobile solutions, and when you might want to choose something else. And we’ll be sure, throughout it all, not to treat Android as the second-most-important mobile platform.",

The results are meant to become a resource for the Kotlin community. Something we can all look at for interesting insights that will also help drive adoption of Kotlin in our teams and organisations.\r\n\r\nTo give you a taster, here’s a few questions I asked in the survey:\r\nHow big is Android as a proportion of all Kotlin developers?\r\nAre people happy naming libraries and tooling with K?\r\nWhat are the favourite features of the language?\r\nWhat kind of DSLs are people building with Kotlin and for what use-cases\r\n\r\nIn my talk will answer all these questions, and more.

How should mobile engineers think about React Native? What dragons need particularly careful slaying on Android?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll give a brief overview of how React Native works. We’ll share how we went from \"git init\" to a functioning app in two months, and talk about where we went from there. We’ll cover the things that still excite us about React Native, but be frank about its continued pitfalls. We’ll talk about how React Native fits into the broader space of cross-platform mobile solutions, and when you might want to choose something else. And we’ll be sure, throughout it all, not to treat Android as the second-most-important mobile platform.",
