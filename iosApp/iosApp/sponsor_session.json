          "description": "If you’ve used Firebase Performance Monitoring, you know that it automatically discovers and reports performance metrics for all the HTTP transactions in your app.  But have you ever wondered how it does that?  Android doesn’t provide any APIs to listen in on an arbitrary connection (that would be a security problem!), and Firebase supports URLConnection, Apache, and OKHTTP APIs.  The secret here is bytecode manipulation at build time using the Transform API provided by the Android build tools.  Join this session to find out how the Firebase Performance Monitoring Gradle plugin intercepts and measures HTTP transactions at runtime with some assistance from bytecode manipulation at build time.",

Yet we can already use Kotlin to connect our platforms and realize significant value.  \r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll learn to build a DSL that defines a contract between an API and its clients.  We’ll make our DSL into a common vocabulary that translates platform idiosyncrasies. Then, by connecting it to CI, we’ll enforce our contract to keep our platforms on speaking terms.\r\n\r\nThe examples in this talk will be from Sprout, an internal library in development at Etsy.  The Sprout Kotlin DSL is the seed that generates code for many platforms: Retrofit endpoints, Moshi models, Swift, PHP, and more.  We’ll look at how to use Kotlin as a templating language, and how the DSL can even generate itself.  Finally we’ll peek at the future potential of these types of DSLs.  What does connecting a Figma file look like?  What about Jetpack Compose and Swift UI?  Let’s dream big and then write a DSL for it.\r\n",

In this talk, Naveen will go over the various performance issues that we discovered with Intellij and our Android codebase. He will dive deep into how we developed “Uber Focus” to significantly improved Intellij’s performance using lazy indexing.

Android development has changed significantly during the time. Kotlin release versions used to have M-notation, now we live in a Kotlin first world, and everyone is waiting on kapt. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of modularization are well known in the community. But what are the steps to get there? In this talk, we will briefly cover our app architecture, and the motivation behind the initial effort in 2016, and how we got to an app with over 300 modules. Then we will dive into several modularization strategies where we started getting immediate benefit of a drastically reduced feedback loop. \r\n\r\nBut the road paved with good intentions might lead you to hell. Through many many bumps, crashes and accidents on the road, those strategies have been evolved to answer many open questions we weren’t sure about initially. How can Dagger help with separation of concerns? How granular each module should be? Where is the glue to stitch everything together? And finally, has build speed actually improved? Join Aaron and Siggi from Android Platform team at Tinder to learn a few things about modularization!",

          "description": "Not everyone can jump right into a Kotlin Multiplatform world.  Many of us have legacy codebases and need to support our businesses first.  Yet we can already use Kotlin to connect our platforms and realize significant value.  \r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll learn to build a DSL that defines a contract between an API and its clients.  We’ll make our DSL into a common vocabulary that translates platform idiosyncrasies. Then, by connecting it to CI, we’ll enforce our contract to keep our platforms on speaking terms.\r\n\r\nThe examples in this talk will be from Sprout, an internal library in development at Etsy.  The Sprout Kotlin DSL is the seed that generates code for many platforms: Retrofit endpoints, Moshi models, Swift, PHP, and more.  We’ll look at how to use Kotlin as a templating language, and how the DSL can even generate itself.  Finally we’ll peek at the future potential of these types of DSLs.  What does connecting a Figma file look like?  What about Jetpack Compose and Swift UI?  Let’s dream big and then write a DSL for it.\r\n",

Individually, each platform has their own norms and customs, filled with M's and V's and Promises, but they aren't alway a good fit to be shared with others. Often they have coupled relationships with the platforms for which they were designed that don't play nicely with others.\r\n\r\nOver the past several months I've been migrating the Chicago Roboto app from a Kotlin first Android app to a multiplatform app, and have learned a lot about things that work well for one platform but not another, and how to make those feel a bit more native. As I share the things I've learned with you, we'll discuss:\r\n\r\n•  Where to start the multiplatform conversion.\r\n•  Adapting native libraries\r\n•  Communicating between shared Kotlin code and native platforms\r\n•  Designing systems that non-Kotlin developers can get behind.",

Last year we started working on Wire 3, which is rewritten in Kotlin, generates Kotlin code, and adds a number of exciting features:\r\n\r\n- Protobuf messages as data classes\r\n- Multiplatform runtime module\r\n- Coroutines-based gRPC APIs\r\n- Gradle plugin\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll take a deep dive into these features, and talk about how we leveraged Kotlin to create better APIs.

Android doesn’t provide any APIs to listen in on an arbitrary connection (that would be a security problem!), and Firebase supports URLConnection, Apache, and OKHTTP APIs.  The secret here is bytecode manipulation at build time using the Transform API provided by the Android build tools.  Join this session to find out how the Firebase Performance Monitoring Gradle plugin intercepts and measures HTTP transactions at runtime with some assistance from bytecode manipulation at build time.",

The Google Assistant on the other hand, the past year quadrupled its active users and it's now available in more than a billion devices. While this number constantly grows, during this years IO we saw a next gen Assistant that is smart, helpful, extremely fast, but most importantly a part of the OS instead of an add-on. From showing notifications and information when asked, to opening apps and complete the action there, the Assistant can get things done faster and better than ever. How do you make sure your content is visible to the Assistant and consequently to your users? How do you make your app \"Assistant ready\"? In this talk we're going to explore among others the brand new app actions and slices for the Assistant, how you can make your own action, while we're also going to touch on some app architecture basics",

Thanks to Immutable State management and Unidirectional Data Flow, we can finally say goodbye to race conditions and rogue mutations. Combine the power of MVI with Kotlin Coroutines alongside the recently released Kotlin Flows library. The result? Real magic. No RxJava incantations required!\r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll learn how to build a Model-View-Intent (MVI) Android App, using both Kotlin Coroutines and Kotlin Flows. You'll walk away understanding the core principles of this pattern, as well as its key benefits.\r\nGet ready to fall for MVI❤!",

The essence of an effective and reliable offline system is a database driven synchronization module that will ensure secure and persistent data storage on the user device as well as performant data ETL between the mobile device, peer to peer, and to the Cloud.  This session will show how Android developers can optimize data management in edge and offlline-first use cases in 5G devices with zero-dba, nano-footprint, AES encrypted and multi-architecture DMBS.

It can even load another app’s code, and execute it.  All this happens without leaving the device, without classic reverse-engineering tools on a developer machine.  \r\n\r\nI’ll walk through the APIs that expose your resources, and show how to put them into action.

Android development has changed significantly during the time. Kotlin release versions used to have M-notation, now we live in a Kotlin first world, and everyone is waiting on kapt. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of modularization are well known in the community. But what are the steps to get there? In this talk, we will briefly cover our app architecture, and the motivation behind the initial effort in 2016, and how we got to an app with over 300 modules. Then we will dive into several modularization strategies where we started getting immediate benefit of a drastically reduced feedback loop. \r\n\r\nBut the road paved with good intentions might lead you to hell. Through many many bumps, crashes and accidents on the road, those strategies have been evolved to answer many open questions we weren’t sure about initially. How can Dagger help with separation of concerns? How granular each module should be? Where is the glue to stitch everything together? And finally, has build speed actually improved?

We also built Wire - a library which processes schemas and generates Java code that applications can use to send and receive data. Last year we started working on Wire 3, which is rewritten in Kotlin, generates Kotlin code, and adds a number of exciting features:\r\n\r\n- Protobuf messages as data classes\r\n- Multiplatform runtime module\r\n- Coroutines-based gRPC APIs\r\n- Gradle plugin\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll take a deep dive into these features, and talk about how we leveraged Kotlin to create better APIs.

Android doesn’t provide any APIs to listen in on an arbitrary connection (that would be a security problem!), and Firebase supports URLConnection, Apache, and OKHTTP APIs.  The secret here is bytecode manipulation at build time using the Transform API provided by the Android build tools.  Join this session to find out how the Firebase Performance Monitoring Gradle plugin intercepts and measures HTTP transactions at runtime with some assistance from bytecode manipulation at build time.",

We’ll make our DSL into a common vocabulary that translates platform idiosyncrasies. Then, by connecting it to CI, we’ll enforce our contract to keep our platforms on speaking terms.\r\n\r\nThe examples in this talk will be from Sprout, an internal library in development at Etsy.  The Sprout Kotlin DSL is the seed that generates code for many platforms: Retrofit endpoints, Moshi models, Swift, PHP, and more.  We’ll look at how to use Kotlin as a templating language, and how the DSL can even generate itself.  Finally we’ll peek at the future potential of these types of DSLs.  What does connecting a Figma file look like?  What about Jetpack Compose and Swift UI?  Let’s dream big and then write a DSL for it.\r\n",

Join us to see an Android developer doing Swift, an iOS developer writing Kotlin and enjoy this thrill ride with two tour guides that will drive you out of your comfort zone while sharing their struggles and success to inspire you to learn the languages. In this talk we'll review similarities and advantages as we  implement an app on both platforms, how to start using the other language once you've given your first steps on either and how you can start your world domination plans with your next line of code.

Android development has changed significantly during the time. Kotlin release versions used to have M-notation, now we live in a Kotlin first world, and everyone is waiting on kapt. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of modularization are well known in the community. But what are the steps to get there? In this talk, we will briefly cover our app architecture, and the motivation behind the initial effort in 2016, and how we got to an app with over 300 modules. Then we will dive into several modularization strategies where we started getting immediate benefit of a drastically reduced feedback loop. \r\n\r\nBut the road paved with good intentions might lead you to hell. Through many many bumps, crashes and accidents on the road, those strategies have been evolved to answer many open questions we weren’t sure about initially. How can Dagger help with separation of concerns? How granular each module should be? Where is the glue to stitch everything together? And finally, has build speed actually improved? Join Aaron and Siggi from Android Platform team at Tinder to learn a few things about modularization!",

Now that we have these tools it is time to give users the beautiful motion they've come to expect from top tier apps.\r\n\r\nWe will cover how to practically use MotionLayout to deliver on complex design asks. This will involve reusing Constraints between multiple Transitions, how to apply multiple effects at different points in a Transition, switching between Transitions programmatically or automatically, how to link the progress of MotionLayout to other widgets, and especially how complex interactions with a RecyclerView can be straightforward.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a senior UI developer who knows the intricacies of Animators or someone who has shied away from animation on Android, this talk should give you a working knowledge of how MotionLayout can make a difference in your app and team.",

We decided to re-architect our way out of the mess, and gave a few public updates describing our plans ([2017], [2018]) along the way. This year we have released [Square Workflow], a library for Kotlin and Swift that is the culmination of this effort, and now at the heart of our feature development.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide an introduction to the library’s use and design choices, including how it was inspired by and differs from [React] and [Elm], and how the Kotlin implementation leans on [coroutines].\r\n\r\n[2017]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjoMnsc2lPo\r\n[2018]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw9ZF9-ilac\r\n[Square Workflow]: https://github.com/square/workflow\r\n[React]: https://reactjs.org/\r\n[Elm]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/\r\n[coroutines]: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html\r\n",

The two work together flawlessly to help you build world class distributed systems.\r\n\r\nAt Square, client and server engineers collaborate on Protobuf schemas to define APIs. We also built Wire - a library which processes schemas and generates Java code that applications can use to send and receive data. Last year we started working on Wire 3, which is rewritten in Kotlin, generates Kotlin code, and adds a number of exciting features:\r\n\r\n- Protobuf messages as data classes\r\n- Multiplatform runtime module\r\n- Coroutines-based gRPC APIs\r\n- Gradle plugin\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll take a deep dive into these features, and talk about how we leveraged Kotlin to create better APIs.

Android development has changed significantly during the time. Kotlin release versions used to have M-notation, now we live in a Kotlin first world, and everyone is waiting on kapt. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of modularization are well known in the community. But what are the steps to get there? In this talk, we will briefly cover our app architecture, and the motivation behind the initial effort in 2016, and how we got to an app with over 300 modules. Then we will dive into several modularization strategies where we started getting immediate benefit of a drastically reduced feedback loop. \r\n\r\nBut the road paved with good intentions might lead you to hell. Through many many bumps, crashes and accidents on the road, those strategies have been evolved to answer many open questions we weren’t sure about initially. How can Dagger help with separation of concerns? How granular each module should be? Where is the glue to stitch everything together? And finally, has build speed actually improved? Join Aaron and Siggi from Android Platform team at Tinder to learn a few things about modularization!",

Room just released support for Kotlin Coroutines, and SqlDelight released support for Kotlin Multi-platform. Room has great documentation and hides a lot of implementation detail, while SqlDelight lets you write raw SQL statements with an Android Studio plugin and then generates type-safe code for you. In this session, you'll see a rundown of these two libraries, along with live coding demos to help you decide which library sounds right for you in this Kotlin world.",

But the reality is that this sandbox only protects your data.  Your APK is completely exposed to other apps, including resources, assets, and code.  I wanted to know how much reverse-engineering I could do from within an app, so I built an app that can run on your phone and inspect any other app’s resources, looking at image assets and reading string values.  It can even load another app’s code, and execute it.  All this happens without leaving the device, without classic reverse-engineering tools on a developer machine.  \r\n\r\nI’ll walk through the APIs that expose your resources, and show how to put them into action.  I will demonstrate how we can inspect, and even execute, another app's code.  You will come away with a better understanding of what is and is not protected by the Android Application Sandbox, and which parts of your app are freely available for reverse-engineering.",

Android development has changed significantly during the time. Kotlin release versions used to have M-notation, now we live in a Kotlin first world, and everyone is waiting on kapt. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of modularization are well known in the community. But what are the steps to get there? In this talk, we will briefly cover our app architecture, and the motivation behind the initial effort in 2016, and how we got to an app with over 300 modules. Then we will dive into several modularization strategies where we started getting immediate benefit of a drastically reduced feedback loop. \r\n\r\nBut the road paved with good intentions might lead you to hell. Through many many bumps, crashes and accidents on the road, those strategies have been evolved to answer many open questions we weren’t sure about initially. How can Dagger help with separation of concerns? How granular each module should be? Where is the glue to stitch everything together? And finally, has build speed actually improved? Join Aaron and Siggi from Android Platform team at Tinder to learn a few things about modularization!",
